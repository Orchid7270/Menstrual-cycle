# Menstrual-cycle
'Sundar tar pinakadharahar gangadhar gajacharamamvardhar namo namo'
'Chandra chuda siva sankara parvati ramana ninage namo namo'.Kind of love this song.


My first git project based on menstrual cycle 
Linear regression model for predicting menstrual cycle date.Lot of women claims that they do bleed on newmoon or full moon .
'''Found relationship between moon phase and menstrual cycle'''.For further improvement details like amount
 of water drank during periods,flow rate(since q=av),moon is considered as the queen in astrology and represents 
 Mind.Also moon represents blood and blood vessels,water in astrology.Adding sunsign also will be a good improvement
 This leads to an interesting question.We do need sunlight for vitamin D,What about moonlight?Try to add time spent under
 moonlight to the data.Some women have reported they do bleed during fullmoon and some during newmoon.Is it
 possible to sychronize menstrual cycle to the moon.The graph clearly shows how different symtoms occur during the
 fullmoon and newmoon.We have higher intensity of moonlight during fullmoon and no moonlight during newmoon.Moon does 
 affects tidal waves too.
*Nature is supposed to be perfect nobody is supposed to get hurt during periods,it could be the lifestyles
 Menstrual blood is a mixture of blood, tissue, and other fluids. The water content in menstrual blood can vary, but it's estimated that:

- Menstrual blood is approximately 50-60% water.

This water content comes from various sources, including:

1. Blood plasma: The liquid portion of blood, which is mostly water.
2. Tissue fluid: Fluid from the uterine lining and other tissues that's shed during menstruation.

The remaining 40-50% of menstrual blood is composed of:

1. Red blood cells
2. White blood cells
3. Platelets
4. Uterine tissue
5. Other cellular debris
 These percentages can fluctuate depending on individual factors, such as hormonal changes, menstrual flow, and overall health.
Well the regression model does output in decimals which is pretty bad for date .Since im not sure if i need to round of the date will think of that later or someone could help.But the error is low.
*Everything that flows has a flow rate Q=AV.Sometimes larger area can reduce the pressure if there is no continouos passage,depends on the velocity.Small area and high velocity does reduce pressure since there is a continuous passage.

*Requirements:
.Skyfield library for moon ditance or the diffrence phase of the moon
pip install skyfield
